# Square-Wars-V2
Square wars is a simple game made with Vanilla.JS this updated version is way less buggy and uses ES6
This is my V2 of my game square Wars since I still haven't released my portfolio site so I decided to just release this
piece of it.

This game has one objective stop the blue squares from getting past you...
Shoot them down with the Space Bar...Good Luck

Also note this is only the front-end of the game build, no mongodb or node, enjoy.
